# API_KEY is required for configuring the NGINX Amplify Agent.
# It could be your real API key for NGINX Amplify here if you wanted
# to build your own image to host it in a private registry.
# However, including private keys in the Dockerfile is not recommended.
# Use the environment variables at runtime as described below.

#ENV API_KEY 1234567890

# If AMPLIFY_IMAGENAME is set, the startup wrapper script will use it to
# generate the 'imagename' to put in the /etc/amplify-agent/agent.conf
# If several instances use the same 'imagename', the metrics will
# be aggregated into a single object in NGINX Amplify. Otherwise Amplify
# will create separate objects for monitoring (an object per instance).
# AMPLIFY_IMAGENAME can also be passed to the instance at runtime as
# described below.

#ENV AMPLIFY_IMAGENAME my-docker-instance-123

# The /entrypoint.sh script will launch nginx and the Amplify Agent.
# The script honors API_KEY and AMPLIFY_IMAGENAME environment
# variables, and updates /etc/amplify-agent/agent.conf accordingly.

COPY ./entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

# TO set/override API_KEY and AMPLIFY_IMAGENAME when starting an instance:
# docker run --name my-nginx1 -e API_KEY='..effc' -e AMPLIFY_IMAGENAME="service-name" -d nginx-amplify
